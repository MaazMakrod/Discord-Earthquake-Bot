# Quake Bot, a Discord Earthquake Bot

This bot can be added to a Discord guild to display live updates on earthquakes around the world.

The bot scrapes data from https://VolcanoDiscovery.com, a website which contains current statistics on earthquakes. A user can request the bot to display these statistics through various text commands. The bot displays the requested information in text messages, providing an easy to digest format for guild members. 

Quake Botâ€™s commands are prefixed with a dollar sign to distinguish them from regular text messages.

## Commands
* **$help** - Lists all available commands
* **$earthquake** - Allows the user to see the most recent earthquake that occurred in any place of the world at the time requested.
* **$dailysummary** - Provides a daily summary of all the earthquakes across the globe
* **$strongestquake** - Shows the strongest earthquake that occured today

## How it Works

Although the code can be downloaded locally, we have added the code to replit.com and it can be found [here](https://replit.com/@MaazMakrod/Earthquakez-Bot#main.py). By doing so, we were able to work collectively to create the bot and can run it on a server, rather than our local machine. To run the bot, all you need is its token which for us is held in the ```my_secret``` variable.
