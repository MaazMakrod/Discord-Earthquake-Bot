# Quake Bot, a Discord Earthquake Bot

Quake bot can be added to a Discord guild to display live updates on earthquakes around the world.

Quake bot scrapes data from https://VolcanoDiscovery.com, a website which contains current statistics on earthquakes. A user can request the bot to display these statistics through various text commands. The bot displays the requested information in text messages, providing an easy to digest format for guild members. 

Quake Botâ€™s commands are prefixed with a dollar sign to distinguish them from regular text messages.

## Commands
* **$help** - Lists all available commands.
* **$earthquake** - Allows the user to see the most recent earthquake that occurred in any place of the world at the time requested.
* **$dailysummary** - Provides a daily summary of all the earthquakes across the globe.
* **$strongestquake** - Shows the strongest earthquake that occured today.

## How it Works

Although the code can be downloaded locally, we have added the code to replit.com and it can be found [here](https://replit.com/@MaazMakrod/Earthquakez-Bot#main.py). By doing so, we were able to work collectively to create the bot and can run it on a server, rather than our local machine. To run the bot, all you need is its token which for us is held in the ```my_secret``` variable.

## Designing a Marketing Site

After creating the bot, we moved on to our next challenge as part of the hackathon, to design a mocksite to market our project. This was done by using Figma, and can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/86AVEikWSaby4ix96R1hBW/QuakeBot-Website?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1%3A2&viewport=584%2C-58%2C0.7111635804176331&scaling=min-zoom).

## Creating the Site

Our last challenge was to create the site. At this point in the hackathon, it was close to 1 AM. Our team worked as hard as we could to develop a functional desktop site and by 3 AM we were able to call it a night. The site can be viewed [here](https://earthquake-bot.maazmakrod.repl.co/) and a github repository with the code can be seen [here](https://github.com/MaazMakrod/Earthquake-Bot-Site).
